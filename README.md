# House Price Prediction (Regression)

This repository showcases a machine learning project designed to predict house prices using various regression algorithms and a neural network for performance comparison. The project explores different models to determine the best-performing one based on accuracy metrics. You can view the results and make your own predictions through this [interactive link](https://lucasjs-house-price-prediction.streamlit.app/).

## **Objective**

The objective of this project is to develop a robust and efficient machine learning pipeline to predict house prices based on various features from a real estate dataset. By leveraging a combination of traditional regression models and neural networks, the project aims to:

- Train multiple machine learning models and evaluate their performance using key metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
- Identify the best-performing model and save it for future predictions.
- Provide meaningful visualizations to compare actual and predicted prices, enabling better insights into model performance.
- Demonstrate a scalable and modular approach to building machine learning workflows that can be adapted to similar regression problems.

## **Project Pipeline**

### 1. **Data Loading**
   - Data is loaded from a CSV file.
   - Ensure the file is located in the `data/house_prices.csv` directory.
   - The dataset used is publicly available from the Kaggle House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition.
   
    ðŸ‘‰ [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)  

### 2. **Preprocessing**
   - Filling missing values.
   - Transforming categorical variables into dummies.

### 3. **Data Splitting**
   - Training set: 80%
   - Test set: 20%

### 4. **Model Training**
   - Each model is trained using the training set.
   - The neural network is configured with:
     - 128 neurons in the first layer.
     - 64 neurons in the second layer.
     - `ReLU` activation function.

### 5. **Evaluation**
   - **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Manually calculated using `numpy`.
   - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Calculated with `scikit-learn`.
   - Comparison of actual and predicted values using scatter plots.

### 6. **Select the Best Model**
   - The model with the lowest RMSE is selected as the best-performing model.
   - Model details and metrics are saved to a JSON file for documentation.

### 7. **Build a Streamlit App**
   - A Streamlit application is developed to:
     - Display results.
     - Perform SHAP analysis for interpretability.
     - Dynamically make new predictions based on user inputs.
